The SFD files can be opened and edited in fontforge.
The TTF files can be installed using the command:
# cp *.ttf /usr/share/fonts/TTF/

Braille-cs is standard Czech Braille.

The others are my various attempts to make the fonts more legible on my low res tactile printer: http://schedule2012.rmll.info/Cooking-Braille-in-your-kitchen?lang=en

For example, braille-tubes-cs, was intended to make it easier to find the line you were reading by adding tubes for your fingers to travel down before capital letters.  Braille-long-rotate-cs was just the letters rotated to the left 90 degrees.
