The SFD files can be opened and edited in fontforge.
The OTF files can be installed using the command:

NOTE, this directory is named ttf fonts.  This is a misnomer.  I used to encode these as ttf, but then ran into weird problems, so I have re-encoded them otf...

# mkdir /usr/share/fonts/OTF/
# cp *.otf /usr/share/fonts/OTF/

You may need to regenerate your font cache after this:

# fc-cache -f -s > /dev/null
# mkfontscale /usr/share/fonts/OTF
# mkfontdir /usr/share/fonts/OTF

Braille-cs is standard Czech Braille.

The others are my various attempts to make the fonts more legible on my low res tactile printer: http://schedule2012.rmll.info/Cooking-Braille-in-your-kitchen?lang=en

For example, braille-tubes-cs, was intended to make it easier to find the line you were reading by adding tubes for your fingers to travel down before capital letters.  Braille-long-rotate-cs was just the letters rotated to the left 90 degrees.
